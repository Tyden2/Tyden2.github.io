Tyden Frame, tydendf10@gmail.com
I have the base GitHub account meaning I have the free account.
The repository I created is for school work. 
Firstly I created the repository and ten downloaded the desktop version of GitHub. I opened the desktop app and from there followed the directions of clicking on file in the top left and selecting Clone Repository. From there I selected my repository and selected where I wanted to put it on my computer.

# About Me
## My Interests
I have a couple hobbies including playing soccer, go fishing, playing videogames, and working on cars. I like to be outside more than inside and most of my hobbies reflect that except for playing videogames. For my academic interests I am majoring in Business Analytics and want to go into a field where I can provide data analysis for companies. Outside of my hobbies and academics I focus on spending time with my family.

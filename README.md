I have the base GitHub account meaning I have the free account.
The repository I created is for school work. 
Firstly I created the repository and ten downloaded the desktop version of GitHub. I opened the desktop app and from there followed the directions of clicking on file in the top left and selecting Clone Repository. From there I selected my repository and selected where I wanted to put it on my computer.
